      This project explores the conflict between economic interests and ecological responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      The animation illustrates the growing burden of plastic pollution in the world’s oceans. It questions the relationship between increasing consumption, corporate profit, and environmental accountability.
    </p>

    <p>Facts on plastic pollution and corporate impact:</p>

    <p>
      Plastic is not only an environmental issue – it is deeply embedded in global economic systems.
      Multinational corporations such as Walmart, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo use vast amounts of plastic for packaging, especially for private label products.
      This visualization is based on publicly available data and shows a projection of plastic volumes through 2090, assuming a “business-as-usual” scenario (i.e. no major regulations or behavioral changes).
    </p>

    <p>Key figures:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In 2020, approximately 367 million tons of plastic were produced globally. Around 23% (~86 million tons) ended up in the oceans.<br>

      <li>
        Walmart reported plastic packaging usage of approximately 1.2 million tons in the same year. No updated figures have been published since.<br>

      </li>
      <li>
        Walmart has publicly committed to reducing plastic use but stated in early 2025 that it is unlikely to meet the goals of the US Plastics Pact by 2025.<br>

        Without regulatory action, global plastic waste could exceed 1 billion tons by 2090.<br>
